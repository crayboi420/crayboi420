## Intro
Hey I'm Kanav, a Master's Graduate in Material Science at DTU, Denmark. I'm an avid learner and am interested in material simulations.

However, my interests aren't just limited to physics simulations. I'm also very interested in Data Engineering and Backend Development. I have a strong proficiency in python and am developing my skills in languages like Go and C++ to develop a deeper understanding of coding in general.
