## Intro
Hey I'm Kanav, a student studying Material Science at DTU, Denmark. I'm an avid learner and am interested in material simulations.
I have recently been learning Computational Fluid Dynamics and will be quite proficient by the end of the semester.

However, my interests aren't just limited to physics simulations. I'm also very interested in Data Science and game dev.
I don't have much experience in either however but would like to undertake any projects related to them. I love algorithms
which is the main reason game dev and data science interest me.

## Projects
I have undertaken a couple of projects on my own and with help from professors at DTU.
 - The first is a neural network to classify. I used the classic MNIST data set. I coded the propagation steps and the matrix multiplications
 myself. It was an exercise to compare single threaded training to training by inbuilt libraries like pytorch. I also tried to use CUDA in the
 inbuilt libraries to further highlight the difference between the two.
 - The second project was a special project in collaboration with Prof. Henri Hattel at DTU Mechanical. It was part of a special course undertaken
 over 3 weeks and was a diffusion solver. The goal was to build a 1-D solver to simulate temperature and material diffusion during segregation in 
 a 2-phase alloy.
