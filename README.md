## Intro
Hey I'm Kanav, a student studying Material Science at DTU, Denmark. I'm an avid learner and am interested in material simulations.
I have recently been learning Computational Fluid Dynamics and will be quite proficient by the end of the semester.

However, my interests aren't just limited to physics simulations. I'm also very interested in Data Science and game dev.
I don't have much experience in either however but would like to undertake any projects related to them. I love algorithms
which is the main reason game dev and data science interest me.
